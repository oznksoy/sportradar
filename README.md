# Sportradar Coding Exercise
# Scoreboard Implementation:

Aim of the module is to create a scoreboard module that can record and display:
- Start of the match between two teams as home team and away team.
- Recording updates to the scoreboard
- Finalizing matches, thus removing the finished matches from the scoreboard.
- Returning a summary of the currently running matches from the scoreboard records.
